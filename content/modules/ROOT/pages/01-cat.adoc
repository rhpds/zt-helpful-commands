The first step towards modifying files is knowing which files exist. Use
`+ls+` to take a look at the contents of the current directory:

[source,bash]
----
ls
----

Use the `+cat+` command to quickly check what is in file `+quote.txt+`.
The `+cat+` command is short for "`concatenate`", but it is much more
versatile than that name suggests.

[source,bash]
----
cat quote.txt
----

Now you can complete the quote by redirecting the output of the `+echo+`
command. The command below uses the append redirection operator (`+>>+`)
to cause the output of the `+echo+` command to be written to the end of
the file _quote.txt_.

[source,bash]
----
echo "makes it seem more manageable." >> quote.txt
----

There is no output, so view the file contents once again to see this
change reflected:

[source,bash]
----
cat quote.txt
----

The `+>>+` operator allows you to add to files from the command line and
is particularly useful in shell scripting. You can also use it when a
command has a lengthy output and you want to view that output in a text
editor.

_NOTE:_ You may also encounter the `+>+` redirection operator. This
operator will write the output to a file, overwriting the file if it
already exists. By contrast, the `+>>+` operator will append the output
to the specified file. The input operator (`+<+`) will redirect data as
an input to whatever is called before the operator. The pipe operator
(`+|+`) is used to send the output of one command to another command so
that you can carry out an operation on the results of the first command.
